# Premier-League-Club-Investment-Analysis
An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project using Python

Domain: Sports (Football)

## OBJECTIVE 

To conduct an exploratory data analysis on potential investments in one of the top-performing clubs in the English Premier League. Some of the more established clubs have already been owned by the competitors, so the management of the firm is seeking to identify clubs that have a high potential for future success and performance.

## DATA

The dataset comprises crucial information about all the clubs that have participated in premier league tournaments. Here is a data dictionary that outlines the information we have about the clubs and their performance.

### DATA DICTIONARY:

  ⚽ Club: Name of the football club

  ⚽ Matches: Number of matches the club has played in the Premier League

  ⚽ Wins: Number of matches won by the club in the Premier League

  ⚽ Loss: Number of matches lost by the club in the Premier League

  ⚽ Clean Sheets: Number of matches in which the club has prevented the opposing side from scoring

  ⚽ Draws: Number of matches drawn by the club in the Premier League

  ⚽ Team Launch: Year in which the club was founded

  ⚽ Winners: Number of times the club has won the Premier League

  ⚽ Runners-up: Number of times the club has finished as runners-up in the Premier League

  ⚽ lastplayed_pl: Year in which the team last played in the Premier League

## Key learning after this project:

  ⚽ Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset.

  ⚽ Observation writing involves examining the data and noting any notable findings, anomalies, or areas of interest.

  ⚽ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and visualizing a dataset to understand its main characteristics, such as the distribution of data, the relationships between variables, and any anomalies or patterns that may exist. The goal of EDA is to uncover insights and trends that can help inform further analysis or decision-making. It is often the first step in any data analysis project, as it provides a foundation for more advanced statistical methods and models.

  ⚽ Treat Null values basis domain knowledge aka using Domain-specific imputation
